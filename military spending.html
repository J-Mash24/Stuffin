	<h2>Military Spending</h2>
  <p>By using SQL, Python and a little bit of Excel, I've done a small analysis. This time is not about sports. It's about countries defensive capabilities. I found out some interesting things. We are kind of in trouble, but on the other hand, things might be not as bleak as public opinion may suggest.</p>
  <p>1. USA is still head and shoulders above everybody else, when it comes to military spending. In 2023 USA will spend 750bln.$. China is in second place with 237bln.$. Then it's Saudi Arabia, India, UK and so on. Germany is sixth on this list. Problem is, that USA needs to worry about every region. Weather is war in Ukraine, conflict in Israel, tensions in the Pacific. Basically, every bigger conflict involves USA one way or another. That's why, that gap between China and USA might not be as big as it may seem. Militarily, China worries basically just about Pacific region.</p>
  <p>2. Henry Kissinger, when he was a secretary of state, used to ask a question: 'Who do I call when I want to talk to Europe?' As Matthew Karnitsching put it in his article: "No one’s calling anyway. Of the myriad geostrategic illusions that have been destroyed in recent days, the most sobering realization for anyone residing on the Continent should be this: No one cares what Europe thinks." And that's true. Even though, EU has the third biggest GDP in the world, trailing just USA and China. But unlike those two countries, EU can't defend itself. And it's by choice. In the 1990, out of the top 5 EU economies, only Italy spent less than 2% GDP on their defense. France was around 2.8%, Germany 2.5%. Right now, only France hovers around 2%. Germany's about 1.4%. Have in mind, that there's a war going on in Europe. Problem is, that there are no urgency. Even after the eruption of war, there were no significant changes. And there are other problems too: migrant crisis in the south, tensions between Kosovo and Serbia or Greece and Turkey. It seems, that very little is being done about solving those issues. So, maybe we shouldn't be surprised about EU irrelevancy after all.</p>
  <p>3. Another thing, military size. Sure, weapons matter, and western world have a variety of them, but as we're seing, humans still matters very much. Somebody needs to control drones, tanks, war planes and etc. And there, we have an issue. If you look at the top 10 military sizes, there're no European countries. And potentially, it could be an issue. Authoritarian countries doesn't care about human lives. So, we don't spend enough on military, doesn't have military size, so what do EU have?</p>
  <p>I've also added a table about nuclear weapons, since they are always an option.</p>
  <p>Bottom line is this, if EU won't change it's approach, we might be in a world of trouble, since USA can't keep their eye on everything.</p>
  <p>P.S. Here's a link to Karnitsching's article. I think it's worth reading, since he explains pretty clearly the situation, that Europe is in right now.
