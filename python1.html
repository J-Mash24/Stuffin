        <h2>Olympic Medals</h2>
        <p>I was casually messing around and thought it would be fun to combine two of my favourite things: Sports and Data.</p>
        <p>So, I tried to dig deeper into Men and Women 100M sprint olympic history, and with some help from SQL and Python I've came up with some relatively interesting conclusions.</p>
        <p>1. USA is absolutely dominating this race. They've one over half medals in men's race. They have 56% of gold medals and 52% of silver medals. 'Only' 29% of bronze medals.</p>
        <p>Women are less dominant and have 40% of gold, 27% of silver and 11% of bronze.</p>
        <p>2. A lot of people think of Jamaica as a sprinters country. But if you look a bit deeper, it's kind of a myth. Sure, they have just 2,8mln., but still. You would expect them to be dominant, right? But they were not.</p>
        <p>Through 2016 olympics (data are from 1896 until 2016), Jamaica won 21 total medals (13 by women and 8 by men).</p>
        <p>Take Usain Bolt aside, and Jamaica have no olympic champion.</p>
        <p>From 1976 when Donald Quarrie won silver in Monreal, Jamaica couldn't win a medal until 2008, when Usain Bolt snatched gold. If you take Usain Bolt aside (again). Yes, I know it's not fair, but stay with me. üôÇ Only Yohan Blake did win silver back in 2012. Other than that, there's nothing to show.
With women, it's a bit different story.</p>
<p>From 1984, they've won 13 medals, including 3 gold. Unlike men, they're leading the way in 100M sprint. In 2008 olympics, they took all three spots on the pedestal. In the next two summer olympics, they took two spots.
In conclusion, women are showing men the way in sprint. So, maybe Jamaica is dominant after all. Just in women's case. üôÇ </p>
<p>3. First athlete to run faster than 10s and win a medal was Jim Hines in 1968. What's interesting, that until then, people were gruadally coming towards that goal, but after 1968 olympics, it took 16 years, until 1984 Los Angeles olympics, to break that 10s barrier. Carl Lewis done that. Why was that?
It's hard to say. Maybe that Jim Hines achievement was kind of a fluke. Because you would expect people to improve, so the simple guess would've been, that in 1972 it would happen again. But it didn't. Sure, you should take into consideration, that USA boycotted 1980 olympics in Moscow, so maybe it would've happened quicker. Who knows. In 1976 Haseley Crawford came really close and ran 10.06s. But fact to the matter is that it didn't happen and maybe that Jim Hines race was a fluke after all.</p>
<p>4. From 1992 no USA sprinter have won gold in the olympics. The clock is still ticking at least until Paris olympics in 2024. Knowing, that USA men sprinters have 56% of gold medals, it's kinda unreal.</p>
<p>On the other hand, from 1932 until 1960, USA men sprinters have won gold. So, for 28 years, USA had the best sprinters in the world. If you want to go further, from 1932 until 1972, they've lost only once. In 1960 olympics, Armin Hary did won gold.</p>
<p>Sorry, if I've done some spelling mistakes. It's almost 2am, when I'm writing this. üòÅ Hopefully it was at least somewhat interesting.</p>
