<h2>Olympic Medals (Marathon (Women))</h2>
  <p>As promised, I've done some research about olympic women marathon. As I was preparing, I've looked at the data and saw, that first olympic marathon was ran back in 1984. I thought it was some kind of mistake, but no. First men marathon was ran in 1896. It took 88 years for women to compete in olympic marathon. Alexandria Gouveia wrote in her article: "Who run the world? Girls! Well, actually, not before the 1970s, thanks to stubborn US governing bodies.</p>
  <p>The Amateur Athletic Union, an organisation founded to “promote physical fitness”, banned women from competing in marathons after incorrectly claiming that long-distance running could cause infertility." </p>
  <p>Undeterred, in 1966, after having her race entry denied with a note claiming women were not physically capable of running a marathon, Roberta Gibb ran the Boston Marathon. She hid behind a bush at the start of the race before taking part as an unregistered runner.</p>
  <p>A year later, Kathrine Switzer was granted entry to the Boston Marathon after registering as a gender neutral-sounding KV Switzer. However, three kilometres into the race, an official infamously grabbed her in an attempt to physically throw her out. She managed to finish the race, and went on to run again in 1968 and 1969. However, it wasn’t until 1972 that women were officially allowed to participate in the Boston Marathon. Switzer returned in 1975 to get a personal best of 2 hours 51 minutes.</p>
  <p>By the mid-1970s, running began to be recognised as a popular sport among women, but it was still not enough to convince the Olympics to hold a women’s marathon competition. Enter Switzer again. After much campaigning and a hard-working partnership with Avon, she is now considered instrumental in getting the women's marathon recognised as an official discipline at the 1984 Olympics.</p>
  <p>Because of that, data sample size is really small and that's why it's hard to make any conclusions out of it.</p>
  <p>Japan is second in the medal table, but their last olympic medal was back in 2004. Kenya is running away with it, having 5 in this table and adding two more in the last olympics ( this data doesn't include Tokyo 2020 games).
There were 10 athletes who ran marathon faster than 2:25:00, which is really impressive. For example, in the past Tokyo olympics, none of the athletes reached that mark. Peres Jepchirchir won with 2:27:20. But it was after Covid-19 pandemic, so no surprise, that results weren't great. </p>
<p>If we will look at recent results, it seems, that Ethiopia and Kenya are heading for a heated rivalry. Women record belongs to Mary Jepkosgei KEITANY. Meanwhile olympic record and WC record is being held by Tiki GELANA and Tigst ASSEFA, who reached the record in September of 2023. She ran a marathon in 2:11:53, which is still under ratification, but if it's approved, then it will be more than 2 minutes faster, comparing to the previous one. It gives a hope, that olympic record may fall in the next olympics. This is it for now. Until next time.</p>
