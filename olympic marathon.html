	<h2>Olympic Marathon Medal Winners Analysis</h2>
    <p>This time I've done some analysis about Olympic Marathon Medal Winners. 
There is a common opinion, that African runners are dominating this event, but reality is a bit different. </p>
<p>Sure, a lot of African countries were still colonies pre-WWII period. For example, Kenya got their independence in December of 1964, so it's hard to judge those numbers objectively. But even after the majority of African countries got their independence, they still weren't dominating this competion as might think. It's only men race, but some things jump out.</p>
<p>1. African runners are taking charge, by winning last four marathons ( this data don't include 2020 Tokyo games, but it's winner was from Kenya. Just to mention.)</p>
<p>2. Until 1960, only one runner from Africa (RSA), won olympic gold in men marathon.</p>
<p>3. It seems, that African domination begins about now, because from 1968, when Mamo Wolde won gold for Ethiopia, until 1996 when RSA won gold in Atlanta, no African runner have snatched first place in Olympic men marathon. </p>
<p>4. When you look at the medal table, in the Top10, just 3 countries are from Africa. Ethipiopia stands 1st, Kenya was 4th, but after Tokyo 2020 games they went to 3rd and RSA is 5th. Surprisingly, France is still 4th, but their last medal was back in 1956. What's ironic, that French athlete named Emile Champion didn't win. He finished second back in 1900. :) He lost to his native Michel Theato.</p>
<p>5. Europeans are doing pretty well in this discipline. They are not overmatch as much, as I've thought at first. Even in the last olympics, they've won silver and bronze (silver went to Netherlands and bronze to Belgium). In the medal table in the Top10, there are 4 European countries.</p>
<p>I'll do women race a bit later, so maybe the view will be a bit different.
Bottom line is that, even though African runners won last 4 Olympic men marathons, but their domination is not as obvious, as you might assume.</p>
<p>P.S. I've done this using SQL and Python. The variety of charts are not plenty, but I've tried to make it understandable and clean.</p>
