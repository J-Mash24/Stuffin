	<h2>German Politics</h2>
  <p>German ruling parties had a subpar performance in this years EP elections. Main ruling party SDP managed to receive only 13.94% of votes. Next major election will be held in the fall of 2025. But people are showing signals, that they're unhappy. I've looked at some categories and tried to make some sort of sense of it.</p>
  <p>1. German economy is struggling. And it's been that way for a while. Corporate Finance Institute is saying, that for a developed country 2-3% of GDP growth is being considered normal. In the last seven years, German economy reached that mark only once in 2021 (3.16%). But in 2023, they've possesed -0.30%. The German economy is seen growing by only 0.1% in 2024, well below the euro zone average of 0.8%.</p>
  <p>2. Inflation. If a country can keep inflation around 1-2%, then it's being considered acceptable, but in the last three years, since 2021 inflation sky-rocketed by reaching it's peak in 2022 with 6.87%. But it was a universal problem. This year it's expected to ease to 2.4%, but the thing is, that in politics, people tend to remember bad things far longer, than the good ones. And inflation is still significantly higher, than their recent GDP growth.</p>
  <p>3. Illegal immigration. It has been a problem since 2016, when 112k illegal immigrants entered Germany. But there's very little, that has been done about it. Or those measures aren't working. Last year, from January until September more than 92k illegal migrants have crossed German border. 
There was 91986 illegal immigrants in 2022. It's a huge issue, that far-right parties are running on.</p>
<p>Other than that, they're doing pretty well. Unemployment rate is relatively low just around 5.9%, their military spending has finally reached NATO target of 2%. But it looks that their problems are bigger than their achievements and EP election results showed that. Good thing is, that they have more than a year to fix those issues. Because if they won't, then next years Bundestag election results could present some unpleasant surprises. We'll see. There are some charts below that I've created by using Python program.</p>
