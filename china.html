	<h2>China's Global Role</h2>
      <p>I've wanted to dig deeper into China's global role. By using Python I've looked at some basic data and came up with a few conclusions.</p>
      <p>1. Like Jay-Z said, I'm not a businesman, I'm a business, man. If you look at the top Chinese importers, you'll see- USA, South Korea, Japan, Australia. Germany is 7th on that list. On the other hand, NATO describes China as the biggest long-term threat. But they do huge amount of business. How do those points match up?</p>
      <p>2. Potentially, it may have serious repercussions. It looks like China might be preparing for war, if you look at the amount of stocks of rice and wheat. Sure, it might mean nothing. Recently, there were huge floods in China, so you can use that stock there. Maybe it was preparation for those accidents. But... Since biggest economies are so dependable and have such a big ties, China might not even have to go to some sort of military escalation.</p>
      <p>In the US, 80% of shore cranes have been made by ZPMC, that's Chinese state-owned company. Recently, there was a podcast by WSJ, where they were talking about potential spying. There was a case, where US officers found 12 modems on those cranes, even though, they weren't suppose to be there. But if they don't want that, they can mess with supply chains.</p>
      <p>When China was in lockdown because of Covid pandemic, world supply chains got really messed up. Prices sky rocket. So, if China would want to be mean, unlike Russia, they don't necessarily have to go to armed conflict. They can mess up with a lot of different things. </p>
      <p>And yes, China have their own problems. Fertility rate, youth unemployement, stagnation in the construction sector. </p>
      <p>USA is trying to limit their growth, but to a limited success thus far. Maybe in the near future they'll get more strict on sanctions.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, China exports more to those countries, that they import. So they do need those markets like USA, South Korea or Japan. They export to USA 501bln.$ worth of goods, but import only 165bln.$ worth of products. With other countries is about even, but still. In a way, situation is similar to that Simpsons episode, where doctor told Mr. Burns, that you have all possible diseases, but they're all in a perfect balance, so you are totally fine, but a small draught can kill you. And Mr.Burns replied, I'm indestructable.</p>
      <p>Maybe that balance keeps armed conflict away. Like, those countries understand, that they need China and vice versa. Even though, they don't want to admit that. </p>
      <p>But in the end, I think, that China do have a small upper hand. Here's why:
Last year, out of ten most sold electric vehicle models, seven were Chinese made. Other two was made by Tesla and one by VW.</p>
<p>And second, last year they made 250 GW by using solar plants. USA came up second with 90 GW.</p>
<p>Knowing, that there's a green push going on, and it will be stronger, China have control of a market, of two important sectors. Can the rest of the world catch up? It remains to be seen.</p>
<p> I'll attach diagrams below.</p>
