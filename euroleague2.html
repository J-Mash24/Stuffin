	<h2>Euroleague(Part 2)</h2>
  <p>1. Only three players in modern Euroleague history averaged more than 3 blocks per game. One of whom is Grygorii Khizhniak, who played for "Zalgiris" Kaunas in the early 00's. He still holds the record for blocks average, averaging 3.19 per game. Nobody came close since then, even though more than 20 years has passed.</p>
  <p>2. In my opinion, a solid point guard should be able to run the team as well as be able to score himself. So, I've created a club, where player averaged at least 10ppg and 4.5apg. The list is quite short. It includes only 8 players. All of them are Euroleague legends, maybe except Thomas Heurtel. There was one form "Zalgiris" Kaunas player Ed Cota, who left his mark in Kaunas, in the first part of the 00's.</p>
  <p>3. I've looked at players effeciency and created a club "at least 15ppg-35%3PT-50%2PT-85%FT". To me, it shows, that player is an elite scorer. 5 players made that list. All of them are well-known for their scoring ability.</p>
  <p>4. Yet another club "at least 15ppg-4.5FTA". It showed players, who were not just great shooters, but could also drive the ball and get to the line. To me, one guy who jumped out of that list is Panagiotis Liadelis. He played in the late 90's and early 00's for the various teams. It's surprising that he made the list, what stoods out, is that he averaged 7.71FTA per game. He lived at the line. Closest to him is Dejan Tomasevic with 6. Even though Liadelis was hard to stop, he's barely being mentioned.</p>
  <p>5. It's the last club, that I've created. What I've found, is that only two players in history have averaged double-double. Is Joseph Blair and Mirsad Turkcan. A couple of players came close to that mark.</p>
  <p>The bottom line, that I've come to, is that is really hard to collect numbers in Euroleague, and you have to be a really good player, to stood out.
Also, it was fun, to look back at Euroleague legends, who are being forgotten for whatever reason. And I think, that list's like these, can keep there legacy going.</p>
