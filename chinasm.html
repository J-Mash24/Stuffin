	<h2>Vhina's Emigration</h2>
  <p>Recently I've been listening to The Economist podcast about Chinese fleeing the country. I thought it would be fun idea to look at the bigger picture. By using Python, I've tried to look at some things.</p>
  <p>1. Emigration. From 2009 until 2013, China posted more than -6% of emigration. It means, that more people were coming than leaving. During first two Xi's years in office, emigration recorded -7.58% in 2012 and -8.20% in 2013. But next year it flipped to +1.79%. What happened? Xi Jinping took control of major power centers in China, the party, the army and the state. Plus, rejected any turn to any Western-style liberization. And people reacted.
This year emigration expected to become negative again, but...</p>
<p>NPR.org published an article, where they said, that 13.500 millionaires were expected to leave China in 2023. A year earlier, 10.800 left China. </p>
<p>Now, it may look like low number, since there are 4.15 million millionaires, that live in China, but trend doesn't look good, because middle class follows. </p>
<p>Last year, Japan gave 2k business manager visas to Chinese sitizens, which was a record.</p>
<p>nikkei.com in october wrote: "According to China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which tracks monthly international financial transactions by domestic banks on behalf of businesses and households, the net outflow reached $53.9 billion in September." It was highest number since 2016.
Extremely strict Covid lockdown measures had a huge impact on that emigration wave.</p>
<p>2. Fertility
It's a well-known issue, so I won't spend much time there. You can see all in the chart. Even though China lifted one child restriction in 2015, it didn't produce the results, that Chinese government had expected. It was declining after that pretty much every year.</p>
<p>3. Ageing
It's nothing new. Europe age's too. Badly. </p>
<p>Statista recently published a nice bar, where it shows ageing situation. I'll publish it below. </p>
<p>In 2013, there were 73.9% of people age 15-64. Last year that number shrunk to 68.3%. It's 5.6% difference in a decade.</p>
<p>Let's try to connect points there. Their upper and middle class are leaving. As of right now, not in a huge capacity, but that number is increasing. It means, that it'll be harder to reboot economy. You have an ageing population, that will be needed to take care of. On top of that, you have struggling economy that USA just put sanctions on.</p>
<p>Now, China won't collapse. But in countries like China or Russia, there's an unwritten rule- we take care of economy, you don't go to politics. But what if economy struggles?</p>
